USE AT YOUR OWN RISK* #####\r\n\r\n### Introduction ###\r\nSeAT attempts to be a EVE Onlineâ„¢ Corporation Management Tool written in PHP using the [Laravel][1] Framework driven by a MySQL database.  \r\nSeAT itself is the result of a rewrite of the original Corporation Management Tool that I wrote for our corp and figured there may be others out there that may need similar tools.\r\n\r\n### Features ###\r\nSeAT allows corporation CEO's and directors to manage member API keys, store member wallet & mail history, monitor corporation poses, wallets, transactions, account ledgers etc.\r\n\r\n### Technical Summary ###\r\nAPI Keys are stored in the backend database and get updated as the schedule is configured. A cronjob gets kicked off every minute that checks which jobs need to be scheduled and actions as required.  \r\nA 'job' can be defined as a set of categorized API calls to update certain part of a Character, Corporation, Eve or Map related information in the backend. More than 55 API Endpoints have been implemented and form part of these jobs.\r\n\r\n### Installation ###\r\nRefer to the `docs/` directory for installation instructions. It is suggested that you checkout the latest release that can be found [here](https://github.com/eve-seat/seat/releases).\r\n\r\n### Upgrading ###\r\nPlease refer to the UPGRADING guide in `docs/UPDGRADING.md`\r\n\r\n### Todo ###\r\nThere really is a TON of stuff that still needs to be done:\r\n\r\n- ~~Corporation Wallet Ledger~~\r\n- ~~Asset Search~~\r\n- ~~Skill Search~~\r\n- ~~Clone Overview~~\r\n- Character Interactions (ie Player Tradings, Mails etc.)\r\n- ~~Starbase Fuel Time Left calculations~~ as well as Silo input/output end etas.\r\n- Corporation Sheets with Member Security Roles view\r\n\r\nThere is a metric ton of information pulled via the API that is not yet exposed on the web front end... so *lots* to do still :)\r\n\r\nA much longer term goal would be to get the system to such a state where corporation members are able to register and view thier own keys and administrators are able to deletegate roles such as recruiters etc.\r\n\r\n### Contact ###\r\nYou can get hold of me via Twitter [@qu1ckkkk](https://twitter.com/qu1ckkkk), ingame character [qu1ckkkk](http://evewho.com/pilot/qu1ckkkk) or on [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.coldfront.net/?nick=seat_user|?#wcs-pub) at #wcs-pub on irc.coldfront.net\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://laravel.com/\r\n\r\n### Legal ###\r\nEVE Online and the EVE logo are the registered trademarks of CCP hf.
