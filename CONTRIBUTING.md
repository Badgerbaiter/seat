# How to contribute

*NB* All pull requests should be made to the `dev` branch of SeAT. Requests into `master` will _almost_ get auto closed. See *Making Changes*

If changes are needed due to vendor packages, please supply a link to the accompanying change log. Typically this would be due to Laravel and or dispatcher changes.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have the latest `dev` version. Rebase your fork with with the origins `seat/dev` if needed.
* Submit your pull requests to `seat/dev` from the topic branch of your fork.
* Ensure that all your commits are descriptive enough to understand what they are either:
    * fixing
    * introducing as a new feature.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the `seat/dev` repository on Github.
