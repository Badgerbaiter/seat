<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>SeAT attempts to be a EVE Onlineâ„¢ Corporation Management Tool written in PHP using the <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> Framework driven by a MySQL database.<br>
SeAT itself is the result of a rewrite of the original Corporation Management Tool that I wrote for our corp and figured there may be others out there that may need similar tools.</p>

<h3>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>SeAT allows corporation CEO's and directors to manage member API keys, store member wallet &amp; mail history, monitor corporation poses, wallets, transactions, account ledgers etc.</p>

<h3>
<a name="technical-summary" class="anchor" href="#technical-summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Summary</h3>

<p>API Keys are stored in the backend database and get updated as the schedule is configured. A cronjob gets kicked off every minute that checks which jobs need to be scheduled and actions as required.<br>
A 'job' can be defined as a set of categorized API calls to update certain part of a Character, Corporation, Eve or Map related information in the backend. More than 55 API Endpoints have been implemented and form part of these jobs.</p>

<h3>

<a name="todo" class="anchor" href="#todo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Todo</h3>

<p>There really is a TON of stuff that still needs to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li><del>Corporation Wallet Ledger</del></li>
<li><del>Asset Search</del></li>
<li><del>Skill Search</del></li>
<li><del>Clone Overview</del></li>
<li>Character Interactions (ie Player Tradings, Mails etc.)</li>
<li>
<del>Starbase Fuel Time Left calculations</del> as well as Silo input/output end etas.</li>
<li>Corporation Sheets with Member Security Roles view</li>
</ul><p>There is a metric ton of information pulled via the API that is not yet exposed on the web front end... so <em>lots</em> to do still :)</p>

<p>A much longer term goal would be to get the system to such a state where corporation members are able to register and view thier own keys and administrators are able to deletegate roles such as recruiters etc.</p>
