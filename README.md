# SeAT Resources Branch
This branch holds resource files for the SeAT project.

## Current Resources:
1. `sde_version.json`  
  Holds information about the current tested EVE SDE for SeAT. Generating this file is normally done with `php tools/prepare_sde_json.php > sde_version.json`, after editing `tools/prepare_sde_json.php` as needed.
