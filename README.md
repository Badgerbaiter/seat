## SeAT - Simple (or Stupid) EVE Online API Tool ##

[![Latest Release](http://img.shields.io/github/release/eve-seat/seat.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/eve-seat/seat/releases/latest)

##### *This is very much BETA software with a ton of things not yet implemented. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK* #####

### Introduction ###
SeAT attempts to be a EVE Onlineâ„¢ Corporation Management Tool written in PHP using the [Laravel][1] Framework driven by a MySQL database.  
The SeAT backend is *highly* influenced by YAPEAL. SeAT itself is the result of a rewrite of the original Corporation Management Tool that I wrote for our corp and figured there may be others out there that may need similar tools.

### Features ###
SeAT allows corporation CEO's and directors to manage member API keys, store member wallet & mail history, monitor corporaton poses, wallets, transactions, account ledgers etc.

### Technical Summary ###
API Keys are stored in the backend database and get updated as the schedule is configured. A cronjob gets kicked off every minute that checks which jobs need to be scheduled and actions as required.  
A 'job' can be defined as a set of categorized API calls to update certain part of a Character, Corporation, Eve or Map related information in the backend. More than 55 API Endpoints have been implemented and form part of these jobs.

### Installation ###
Refer to the `docs/` directory for installation instructions. It is suggested that you checkout the latest release that can be found [here](https://github.com/eve-seat/seat/releases).

### Upgrading ###
Please refer to the UPGRADING guide in `docs/UPDGRADING.md`

### Todo ###
There really is a TON of stuff that still needs to be done:

- ~~Corporation Wallet Ledger~~
- ~~Asset Search~~
- ~~Skill Search~~
- ~~Clone Overview~~
- Character Interactions (ie Player Tradings, Mails etc.)
- ~~Starbase Fuel Time Left calculations~~ as well as Silo input/output end etas.
- Corporation Sheets with Member Security Roles view

There is a metric ton of information pulled via the API that is not yet exposed on the web front end... so *lots* to do still :)

A much longer term goal would be to get the system to such a state where corporation members are able to register and view thier own keys and administrators are able to delegate roles such as recruiters etc.
